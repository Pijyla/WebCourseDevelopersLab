    <i>
    When she was just a girl she expected the world
    But it flew away from her reach
    So she ran away in her sleep
    Dreamed of para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
    Every time she closed her eyes
    
    When she was just a girl she expected the world
    But it flew away from her reach
    And the bullets catch in her teeth
    Life goes on, it gets so heavy
    The wheel breaks the butterfly
    Every tear a waterfall
    In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
    In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
    
    Dream of para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    
    She'd dream of para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    
    Sing, la la la la la la la la la
    La la la la la la la
    And so lying underneath those stormy skies
    She'd say, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
    I know the sun must set to rise"
    This could be para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    
    This could be para-para-paradise
    (Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
    
    This could be para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    
    This could be para-para-paradise
    Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh
    
    This could be para-para-paradise
    Para-para-paradise
    
    This could be para-para-paradise
    (Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
    
    This could be para, be paradise
    Para-paradise
    Para-paradise
    
    This could be para, be paradise
    Para-paradise
    Para-paradise

    You can tell by the way
    She walks that she's my girl
    You can tell by the way
    She talks she woos the world
    You can see in her eyes
    That no one is her change
    She's my girl
    My supergirl
    
    And then she'd say it's OK
    I got lost on the way
    But I'm a super girl
    And super girls don't cry
    And then she'd say it's alright
    I got home late last night
    But I'm a super girl
    And super girls just fly
    And then she'd say
    That nothing can go wrong
    When you're in love
    What can be wrong?
    And then she'd laugh
    The night time into day
    Pushing her fear
    Further alone
    
    And then she'd say it's OK
    I got lost on the way
    But I'm a super girl
    And super girls don't cry
    And then she'd say it's alright
    I got home late last night
    But I'm a super girl
    And super girls just fly
    
    And then she'd shout
    Down the line
    Tell me she's got no more time
    'Cause she's a supergirl
    And supergirl's don't cry
    
    And then she'd scream in my face
    Tell me to leave
    Leave this place
    'Cause she's a supergirl
    And supergirl's just fly
    
    Yeah she's a supergirl
    A supergirl
    She's so in seeds, she's burning trees
    She's so in seeds, she's burning streams
    Yeah she's a supergirl
    A supergirl

    <i>
    Here I go out to sea again
    The sunshine fills my hair
    And dreams hang in the air
    Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
    You know it feels unfair
    There's magic everywhere
    Look at me standing
    Here on my own again
    Up straight in the sunshine
    
    No need to run and hide
    It's a wonderful, wonderful life
    No need to laugh and cry
    It's a wonderful, wonderful life
    
    Sun in your eyes
    The heat is in your hair
    They seem to hate you
    Because you're there
    And I need a friend
    Oh, I need a friend
    To make me happy
    Not stand here on my own
    Look at me standing
    Here on my own again
    Up straight in the sunshine

    [Cheb Mami introduction (Algerian Arabic):]
    Ya lili ah ya leel
    
    Hadaee mada tawila
    Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
    Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
    Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
    
    [English:
    "Oh night oh night
    
    It has been a long time
    And I am looking for myself and my loved one
    And I am looking for myself and my loved one
    And I am looking for myself and my loved one"]
    
    I dream of rain
    I dream of gardens in the desert sand
    I wake in vain
    I dream of love as time runs through my hand
    
    I dream of fire
    Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
    And in the flames
    Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
    
    This desert rose
    Each of her veils, a secret promise
    This desert flower
    No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
    
    And as she turns
    This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
    This fire burns
    I realize that nothing's as it seems
    
    I dream of rain
    I dream of gardens in the desert sand
    I wake in vain
    I dream of love as time runs through my hand
    
    I dream of rain
    I lift my gaze to empty skies above
    I close my eyes
    This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love
    
    [Cheb Mami (Algerian Arabic):]
    Aman aman aman
    Omry feek antia
    Ma ghair antia
    Ma ghair antia
    [English:]
    Aman aman aman
    My life is for you
    And no one other than you
    And no one other than you
    
    I dream of rain
    I dream of gardens in the desert sand
    I wake in vain
    I dream of love as time runs through my hand
    
    Sweet desert rose
    Each of her veils, a secret promise
    This desert flower
    No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
    
    Sweet desert rose
    This memory of Eden haunts us all
    This desert flower
    This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall

    <h1 id="song5">Not afraid</h1>

    <pre>
    <i>
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that you're not alone
    Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
    
    Yeah, it's been a ride
    I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
    Now some of you, might still be in that place
    If you're trying to get out, just follow me
    I'll get you there
    
    You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
    But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
    'Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
    When I say I'mma do something I do it
    I don't give a damn what you think
    I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
    Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
    I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
    And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
    No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
    From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
    He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
    Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
    Whichever comes first, for better or worse
    He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
    His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
    To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe
    
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that you're not alone
    Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
    
    Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
    I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
    You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
    For that fuck your feelings
    Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
    And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
    I promise to never go back on that promise
    In fact let's be honest
    That last "Relapse" CD was "ehh"
    Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
    Relax, I ain't going back to that now
    All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
    'Cause I ain't playing around
    There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
    But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
    Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
    Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
    These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
    
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that you're not alone
    Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
    
    And I just can't keep living this way
    So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
    I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
    I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
    I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
    Time to put my life back together right now! (now)
    
    It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
    Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
    For you, so I could come back a brand-new me you helped see me through
    And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
    I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
    I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
    My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
    And drop dead, no more beef lingers
    No more drama from now on, I wanna promise
    To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
    So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
    And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
    'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
    Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
    'Cause I'm raising the bar
    I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
    I feel amazing and I'm...
    
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that you're not alone
    Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

    [Puff Daddy:]
    Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
    I can't believe this shit
    Can't believe you ain't here
    Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
    It's hard to just keep goin'
    It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
    I would do anything, man, to bring you back
    I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
    I saw your son today, he look just like you
    You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
    I miss you, B.I.G.
    Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
    I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
    
    This right here tell me why
    Goes out to every one that has lost someone that they truly loved
    Come on, check it out
    
    Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
    I laced the track, you locked the flow
    So far from hanging on the block for dough
    Notorious, they got to know
    That life ain't always what it seem to be
    Words can't express what you mean to me
    Even though you're gone, we still a team
    Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream
    (that's right)
    
    In the future, can't wait to see
    If you open up the gates for me
    Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
    Try to black it out, but it plays again
    When it's real, feeling's hard to conceal
    Can't imagine all the pain I feel
    Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
    I know you still living your life after death
    
    [Faith Evans:]
    Every step I take,
    Every move I make
    Every single day,
    Every time I pray
    I'll be missing you
    Thinking of the day,
    When you went away
    What a life to take,
    What a bond to break
    I'll be missing you
    
    [Puff:]
    I miss you B.I.G.
    
    It's kinda hard with you not around
    Know you're in heaven smiling down
    Watching us while we pray for you
    Every day we pray for you
    'Til the day we meet again
    In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
    Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
    Strength I need to believe
    
    My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (can't define)
    Wish I could turn back the hands of time
    Us in the 6,
    Shop for new clothes and kicks
    You and me taking flicks
    Making hits, stages they receive you on
    I still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
    Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
    I know you still living your life after death
    
    [Faith Evans:]
    Every step I take,
    Every move I make
    I miss you
    Every single day,
    Every time I pray
    I'll be missing you
    Thinking of the day,
    When you went away
    What a life to take,
    What a bond to break
    I'll be missing you
    
    Somebody tell me why
    
    One black morning when this life is over I know I'll see your face
    
    [112 (Puff):]
    Every night I pray,
    Every step I take
    Every move I make,
    Every single day
    
    Every night I pray,
    Every step I take
    (Every day that passes)
    Every move I make,
    Every single day
    (Is a day that I get closer to seeing you again)
    
    Every night I pray,
    Every step I take
    (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop)
    Every move I make,
    Every single day
    (Cause we can't stop, that's right)
    
    Every night I pray,
    Every step I take
    Every move I make,
    Every single day
